1) Which sorting is better if we want to sort one sorted array and another unsorted array?
A) In an array half are half are sorted and remaining half are unsorted. If we used bubble sort the entire sorted array also disturbed.
If we use insertion sort then we can pick the elements from unsorted array and we can place that in sn sppropriate place.
If we use selection sort we have to find the minimum element from sorted and unsorted array and we have to check for all elements.
So, Insertion sort is better.

2) Which sorting is better if we want to sort two sorted arrays?
A)In this problem two arrays already sorted. If we perform the selection sort on two arrays min element calculated over two arrays.
Then we will perform swapping operations based on that min value. If we use bubble sort the array is disturbed and the no.of comparisions
and no.of swappings are increased. In selection sort they may less.
So,Selection sort is better.

3)Input is giving not at a time. then which sorting is better?
A) Insertion sort is better. Because our array is already sorted. then user enters another number. if we compare this number with
previous sorted data and we can place in an appropriate position. Here already sorted data is not disturbed and new data is placed
in an appropriate position.
So, Insertion sort is better.
